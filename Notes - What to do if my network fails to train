reasons for training failed:

    reached critical point(gradient = 0)
        local minima
        saddle point
        smaller batch size + momentum may help escape critical points
        
    learning rate was fixed
        use adaptive learning rate
            large step at flat error face
        learning rate scheduling 
            learning rate decay
            warm up
            
    batch size was large
        use smaller batch size
        
    loss function was not approriate
        consider cross entropy for classfication
